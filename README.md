# Assignment-01

Name: Oliver Hancock

    BU: ohancock

For Assignment 01, I created a GitHub repository and cloned it onto both my local machine and EC2 instance. I performed all the tasks specified in the assignment on the EC2 instance. After completing the tasks, I pushed the repository back to GitHub. I completed the tasks using Python (.py) or Shell (.sh) files, as specified in each task.

Task 2: After extracting data and writing a shell script, I ensured the script was executable by running chmod +x count_python.sh in Terminalm followed by verifying the script using ./count_python.sh. The results:
Lines containing 'python' in question_tags.csv: 1064820; Lines containing 'python' in questions.csv: 0

Task 3: I opted to use Python. I wrote the code and ensured the script ran correctly by running python3 count_github.py
